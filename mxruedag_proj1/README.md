Project 1: Prefix Match
=====
The instructions given were:
<i>The only functionality requirement is that, after loading the provided index.html HTML file in a browser, one may begin typing a word into the text field and for each letter input a drop-down list is displayed showing at most ten words from the provided dictionary, sorted lexicographically, which contain the input word as a prefix. If no words match, then no words should be displayed. Your specific task is to create a JavaScript module containing an implementation of a trie data structure to be used as the foundation of the autocomplete functionality.</i>
